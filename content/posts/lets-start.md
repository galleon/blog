In the past, I have authored a number of blogs mainly to store tips and tricks that I found useful. I recently discovered [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) a well known framework for static web pages. I decided to give it a go by connecting it to [Github](https://github.com). Each post is automatically published when pushed in the repository. [Travis](http://travis-ci.org) iis used to transform the markdown based sources in html static files.
My goals with these pages is not different from my previous attemps, I will use them to report things that do resonate for me.

I will start with this movie I discovered recently. *Game Changers* - the name of the movies - depicts the journey of a former mixed martial arts in search of fast recovery after an injury. He began to understand that switching to a plant-based diet would provide him the amount of proteins he needs as an athlet while protecting his body from inflammatory properties found in meat. Obviously the movie send us back to our sends us back to our childhood - a time when we were told that to be strong we needed meat to be strong and we needed milk for stronger bones; the opposite seems to be true, actually. 

The film despite some weaknesses is trying to show some facts and eliminate some myths. A must see, it might change your life ... a little bit ;-)
